# JBServer
### Cross platform server for Minecraft Java and Bedrock Edition

## About
JBServer is cross platform server software for Minecraft Java Edition and Bedrock Edition. The reason of creation of this project was being inspirated by server bridge traslators like GeyserMC and Dragonet. However, I think that JE server softwares weren't made to handle BE conections and each of both editions have many differences, that they couldn't be solved with translating one edition to second. So, I decided to make server, which will handle only important and only same thing on both editions avoiding different things.

## To-Do list
- [ ] Inventories
- [ ] Blocks and Items
- [ ] Worlds
- [ ] Entities
- [ ] Protocol
- [x] Plugin api

## Note
This server software is currently in pre^n - alpha version and has a lot of work to do.
I will try to add as much as it possible
